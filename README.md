# Power App Workshop

### Power Apps:

Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, connectors, and a data platform that provides you with an opportunity to build custom apps for your business needs.

By using Power Apps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your business data that is stored either in the underlying data platform or in various online and on-premises data sources like SharePoint, Excel, Office 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, and so on.

Power Apps simplifies the custom business app building experience by enabling users to build feature-rich apps without writing code.

Power Apps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers programmatically interact with data and metadata, apply business logic, create custom connectors, and integrate with external data.

### Use Case

**Restaurant employee management** - Employees of a large restaurant might fill out work schedules and vacation requests on a piece of paper that's affixed to a wall. With Power Apps running on everyone's smartphone, employees can open the app to record the same information, anywhere, anytime. The app can even send reminders for the start of the next day's shift.

### To Create, Share and Administer apps

we have following options:

- **Make a Power App** - [https://make.powerapps.com/](https://make.powerapps.com/) 
On this site, you can open apps, specify the type of app that you want to create, share your app, and create data connections and flows. To use this site, you'll need to log in by using your organizational account.

- **Power Apps Studio** - [https://create.powerapps.com/studio/](https://create.powerapps.com/studio/)
On this site, you build apps by configuring user interface (UI) elements and Excel-like formulas.

    Power Apps Studio has three panes that make creating apps seem more like building a slide deck in Microsoft PowerPoint:

    - **Left pane** - Shows a hierarchical view of all the controls on each screen or a thumbnail for each screen in your app.
    - **Middle pane** - Shows the canvas app that you're working on.
    - **Right pane** - Where you set options such as the layout, properties, and data sources for certain controls.

- **Power Apps admin center** - [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/)
On this site, you'll define environments and data policies.
- **Power Apps Mobile**
Power Apps Mobile for iOS and Android Devices allows you to use all the apps that you've created, and those others have shared with you, on your mobile device.

### Power Apps Related Technologies

- **Data Sources -** Data sources bring cloud and on-premises data into your apps. You access data through built-in connections, custom connectors, and gateways.
- **Common Data Service** - A compliant and scalable data service that's integrated into Power Apps.
- **Power Automate** - Allows you to build automated workflows to receive notifications, run processes, collect data, and more.

### Ways to build Power Apps

- Create an App from a template
- Create an App from a data source
- Build from a blank canvas

## Developing & Deploying a Power App Project

The Basics of making an app are as follows:
1. **Plan**: Identify the who, what, when and why.

2. **Design:** Model the data and sketch out the app screens

3. **Make:** Create the app.

4. **Test:** Have users try the app.

5. **Deploy and refine:** Get your app into the hands of users and get feedback, and decide what to change or add.

## **Controls in Power Apps**

A control is a UI element that produces an action or shows information. Many controls in Power Apps are similar to controls that you've used in other apps: labels, text-input boxes, drop-down lists, navigation elements, and so on.

In addition to these typical controls, Power Apps has more specialized controls, which you can find on the **Insert** tab.

A few controls that can add interest and impact to your apps include:

- **Galleries** - These controls are layout containers that hold a set of controls that show records from a data source.
- **Forms** - These controls show details about your data and let you create and edit records.
- **Media** - These controls let you add background images, include a camera button (so that users can take pictures from the app), a barcode reader for quickly capturing identification information, and more.
- **Charts** - These controls let you add charts so that users can perform instant analysis while they're on the road.
